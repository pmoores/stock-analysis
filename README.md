# Module 2 Challenge - VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to refractor VBA code to expand the original stock analysis to include the entire stock market in 2017 and 2018.

## Results

### 2017 Analysis
An analysis of the 2017 stocks reveal that all but one stock (TERP) had positive returns (https://github.com/pmoores/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/2017_Results_VBA_Challenge.png). The three stocks with the highest returns are: DQ - 199.4%, SEDG - 184.5%, ENPH - 129.5%.

### 2018 Analysis
The 2018 analysis reveals a much different picture (https://github.com/pmoores/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/2018_Results_VBA_Challenge.png) as only two stocks had positive returns: ENPH - 81.9% and RUN - 84.0%.

### Overall Analysis
An analysis of both years demonstrates that ENPH had the most consistent return. ENPH in 2017 had a return of 129.5% and was one of only two stocks with a positive return in 2018 (81.9%).


## Summary

### General Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
Refactoring code can be advantageous as it allows the programmer to access code that is already developed and adapt it, rather than writing a program from scratch. A main disadvantage is the copied code can introduce a lot of bugs that need to then be fixed before the program runs.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring VBA Code in Current Analysis
In this project, refactoring the code resulted in faster run times (https://github.com/pmoores/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png , https://github.com/pmoores/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png) and was quicker than creating all of the code from nothing. However, refactoring this code took me a very long time because of my inexperience. I found that some errors were more difficult to troubleshoot than others.
